# Chapter 5 — Simulation with Gazebo

Gazebo is a physics-based simulation engine used to test robots safely.

## 5.1 Why Simulation?

Prevents hardware damage

Faster testing

Low cost

Repeatable experiments

## 5.2 Physics Engines

Gazebo supports:

ODE

Bullet

DART

They handle:

Gravity

Collisions

Joint dynamics

### 5.3 Integration with URDF

Humanoid URDF models can be spawned directly inside Gazebo for realistic testing.

## 5.4 Sensor Simulation

Simulates:
