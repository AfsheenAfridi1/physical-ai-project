# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

Physical AI is the domain where intelligent systems operate in the real, physical world. Unlike digital AI models—such as language processors or recommender systems—Physical AI must deal with gravity, motion, friction, balance, and real-world constraints.

# 1.1 Digital AI vs Physical AI

Digital AI:
- Works on text, software, or online data.
- Does not have a physical body.
- Only processes symbols and information.

# Physical AI:
- Must sense the world using cameras, sensors, IMUs.
- Understands objects, motion, physics.
- Takes physical actions (grasp, walk, move, push, avoid obstacles).

# Example:  
A digital AI understands “Pick up the cup.”  
A Physical AI robot must calculate:
- Cup location in 3D  
- Cup shape & material  
- Grip force required  
- Balance and stability  
- Collision-free arm path  
- Final placement position  

# 1.2 Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence means AI that learns and acts through a physical body.  
Real-time control loop:

Sensors → AI Model → Motor Commands → Physical Action → New Sensor Input

This happens dozens to thousands of times per second.

# 1.3 Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are effective because:
- Our world is built for human size and shape  
- Vast human motion data is available  
- Communicate naturally (speech, gestures)  
- Can use human environments (tools, doors, stairs, vehicles)
